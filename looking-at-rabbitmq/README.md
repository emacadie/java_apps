I am going to look at some APIs for Rabbit MQ in a few different languages.     

Java code from the Rabbit MQ tutorial page: http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html     

I will try Ruby with http://rubyamqp.info/    

gradle/ has Groovy Java with Gradle    
rabbitmq-java/ has Java with Maven    
rabbitmq-ruby/ has Ruby
