New In Java 9:
Modularity, in 2017
1. Modules - JDK is modularlized, and you can modularize your app
2. JShell - like a REPL?
3. Library and Language improvements
4. New APIs -
5. Desktop Java enhancements
6. Performance and Security

The Module System
One of the biggest changes in Java, ever
Affects language, compiler, virtual machine, tooling

Why add it?
One reason: to modularize the JDK, address technical debt, make JDK more maintainable
Also: Now applications can be modularized
Using it is optional in your apps

Before: Java was in huge JAR: rt.jar, many entangled classes, runtime was hard to evolve
Java likes to maintain backwards-compatibility
There are 90 platform modules
java.base is most important
The API pages for a module will show you a modules depedencies
(but not what modules depend on it)
No cyclid dependecies

java.corba is now in its own module
advantages: increases security, since some packages can now be hidden
many small parts, reduced footprint
easy deprecation
java.corba: Marked for deprecation in java 9, not in java 11

what is a module?
module has a name, it groups related code, and is self-contained
are JAR files modules? they have filenames, but that is not important at run-time
They do group related code, but they can use classes from another JAR, and they have weak boundaries
In a module, some packages are available to other modules, and some are private and cannot be accessed outside module
so no more using com.sun.misc
module descriptor is in module-info.java
module java.base {
    exports java.lang;
    exports java.util;
    exports java.io;
    // many more
}
The packages that are encapsulated are not mentioned in the descriptor
What about modules that depend on other modules?
say, java.sql, which depends on java.logging and java.xml:
module java.sql {
    exports java.sql; // these are package names
    exports javax.sql;
    exports javax.transaction.xa;
    requires java.logging; // these are module names
    requires java.xml;
}
"module", "exports" and "requires" are only keywords in module-info.java
You can list modules:
java --list-modules
You can grep for a module
Describe a module:
java --describe-module java.sql
result:
java.sql@15.0.2
exports java.sql
exports javax.sql
requires java.xml transitive
requires java.logging transitive
requires java.transaction.xa transitive
requires java.base mandated
uses java.sql.Driver

migration concerns:
You should still be able to run w/using classpath in the commands
unless:
1. You use JDK classes that have been encapsulated
2. You use types from non-default Java modules
what to do about #1:
JDK will create a virtual module w/your JARs
For now apps w/encapsulated classes, will compile w/JDK8 and run w/JDK9
But will not not compile w/JDK9
New code plays by the rules
if you really really have to, you can run with "java --illegal-access=permit"
I think "--illegal-access=permit" was removed. I don't see it when I run "java --help" w/Java 15
There was a "--add-exports" option for javac and java, but I think that was removed too.
To find dependencies, run "jdeps" tool
jdeps -jdkinternals SomeClass.class
It will tell you if you are using an encapsulated class, and suggests replacements

#2:
javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter - was available before in JDK
now in java.xml.bind (in JDK 9, deprecated for removal)
many app servers have their own xml jars
use "javac --add-modules java.xml.bind"
Also do that when you run: "java --add-modules java.xml.bind"
jdeps will help with this

JShell: A REPL for Java
https://github.com/mrsarm/jshell-plugin
https://github.com/bitterfox/jshell-gradle-plugin
Not intended to replace other tools
https://plugins.gradle.org/search?term=jshell
You can test out ideas
No need to create a class (but you can do this w/tests)
Explore APIs
https://advancedweb.hu/prototyping-with-jshell/
https://advancedweb.hu/using-external-libraries-in-jshell/

at console, type "jshell"
to exit: "/exit"
Or control-D
Bit shifting is a good thing to try here
same w/regular expressions
control-L clears screen
has tab-completion
It would be great to use this w/Maven or Gradle

JShell and environment
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/jshell/commands.htm
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/jshell/toc.htm
You can use /open to open a *.jsh file, or *.java file
set classpath to load JARs
jshell --class-path .....
StringUtils.leftPad(
Then type tab
If there are multiple arg combos, they will be displayed

Module 4: Lang changes

Collection factory methods
Collections: The old way:
List< String > books = new ArrayList< String >();
books.add( "aaaa" );
books.add( "bbb" );
books.add( "ccccc" );
Verbose
Won't work as field initializer
Now we have "of" methods
Null not allowed
List.of(  ) creates an immutable list
List< Integer > ints = List.of( 1, 2, 3 )
Good for small collections
Overloaded to 10 elements
java.util.ImmutableCollections
There is also Set.of
Map.of and Map.ofEntries

Perhaps time to look into persistent collections
w/Map.of, you gives args alternating between keys and values
Map.of( "Key1", 1, "Key2", 2 )
Need to have even number of args
ofEntries takes entries (looks like a LOT of typing)
From javadoc:
 import static java.util.Map.entry;

     Map<Integer,String> map = Map.ofEntries(
         entry( 1, "a" ),
         entry( 2, "b" ),
         entry( 3, "c" ),
         ...
         entry( 26, "z" ) );
.
Stream API:
Streams can only be used once
You can use map, filter, forEach, other transformation APIs,
until a terminal operation (like forEach, or collect (which converts to a collection), or reduce)
Added methods added:
takeWhile
dropWhile
ofNullable: Returns a sequential Stream containing a single element, if non-null, otherwise returns an empty Stream.
iterate

takeWhile takes a predicate
sort of like filter, but it stops on the first element that fails the filter; later elements that fulfill predicate are dropped
dropWhile is opposite of takeWhile - starts on first element that fails filter; later elements that fulfill predicate are kept
You should probably use this with sorted collections

Stream API: New collectors
They materialize the stream into a new collection
From javadoc for java.util.stream.Collectors: Implementations of Collector that implement various useful reduction operations,
such as accumulating elements into collections, summarizing elements according to various criteria, etc.
Also Collectors.groupingBy
